# Bertelsmann Arvato Financial Services: Customer segmentation

This project was done as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project. The data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics who is a partner of Udacity and it is a real life dataset. Hence, the data is confidential and will not be found in this repository.

## Data:

1) azdias: Demographic data for the general population of Germany. Contains 891221 rows and 366 columns.
2) customers: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company. Contains 191652 rows and 369 columns.
3) DIAS Attributes — Values 2017.xls/ DIAS Information Levels — Attributes 2017: Contains details about the various attributes of the azdias/ customers files.
4) mailout_train & mailout_test: Demographic data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign.

## Goal of the project:

1) Customer segmentation: Identify the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company using the customer base data of the company.
2) Target prediction: Predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. To achieve this, we will use the demographics information for      targets of a marketing campaign.

The first goal will be achieved using unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation and the second goal will be achieved using supervised learning techniques.
